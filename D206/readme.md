Data Cleaning continues building proficiency in the data analytics life cycle with data preparation skills. This course addresses exploring, transforming, and imputing data as well as handling outliers. Learners write code to manipulate, structure, and clean data as well as to reduce features in data sets. The following courses are prerequisites: The Data Analytics Journey, and Data Acquisition.<P>
# Part I: Research Question

## A. 
Describe one question or decision that could be addressed using the data set you chose. The summarized question or decision must be relevant to a realistic organizational need or situation.

## B. 
Describe all variables in the data set (regardless of the research question) and indicate the data type for each variable. Use examples from the data set to support your claims.

# Part II: Data-Cleaning Plan

**Note:** You may use Python or R for implementing your coding solutions, manipulating the data, and creating visual representations.

## C. 
Explain the plan for cleaning the data by doing the following:

1. Propose a plan that includes the relevant techniques and specific steps needed to assess the quality of the data in the data set.

2. Justify your approach for assessing the quality of the data, including the following:
   - characteristics of the data being assessed
   - the approach used to assess the quality of the data

3. Justify your selected programming language and any libraries and packages that will support the data-cleaning process.

4. Provide the annotated code you will use to assess the quality of the data in an executable script file.

# Part III: Data Cleaning

## D. 
Summarize the data-cleaning process by doing the following:

1. Describe the findings for the data quality issues found from the implementation of the data-cleaning plan from part C.

2. Justify your methods for mitigating the data quality issues in the data set.

3. Summarize the outcome from the implementation of each data-cleaning step.

4. Provide the annotated code you will use to mitigate the data quality issues—including anomalies—in the data set in an executable script file.

5. Provide a copy of the cleaned data set as a CSV file.

6. Summarize the limitations of the data-cleaning process.

7. Discuss how the limitations summarized in part D6 could affect the analysis of the question or decision from part A.

## E. 
Apply principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the significant features of the data set by doing the following:

1. Identify the total number of principal components and provide the output of the principal components loading matrix.

2. Justify the reduced number of the principal components and include a screenshot of a scree plot.

3. Describe how the organization would benefit from the use of PCA.
